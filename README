Apache module mod_authnz_pam
============================

Apache module mod_authnz_pam serves as PAM authorization module,
supplementing authentication done by other modules, for example
mod_auth_kerb. It can also be used as a full Basic Authentication
provider for testing purposes, running the [login, password]
authentication through the PAM stack.

The primary intended use is in connection with sssd and pam_sss.so.

Module configuration
--------------------

Authorization:

Let us assume there is already Kerberos authentication configured:

    <Location /private>
      AuthType Kerberos
      AuthName "Kerberos Login"
      KrbMethodNegotiate On
      KrbMethodK5Passwd Off
      KrbAuthRealms EXAMPLE.COM
      Krb5KeyTab /etc/http.keytab
      KrbLocalUserMapping On
      Require valid-user
    </Location>

The Require valid-user line can be replaced by

    Require pam-account pam_service_name

for example to run authorization check for the Kerberos-authenticated
user using the PAM service pam_service_name.

This can be useful to get for example host-based access control from
an IPA server for the web service.

Basic Authentication:

The module is configured using the

    AuthBasicProvider PAM

directive and then by specifying the PAM service name:

    AuthPAMService name_of_the_PAM_service

      The PAM service to authenticate against.

Example:

    <Location /private>
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "private area"
      AuthBasicProvider PAM
      AuthPAMService tlwiki
      Require valid-user
    </Location>

The PAM service needs to be configured. For the above shown
tlwiki example, file /etc/pam.d/tlwiki could be created with content

    auth    required   pam_sss.so
    account required   pam_sss.so

to authenticate against sssd.

Handling expired password:

    AuthPAMExpiredRedirect <URL>

For both the authorization and HTTP Basic authentication case, if the
password the user has presented has expired (PAM return codes
PAM_CRED_EXPIRED or PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD), when AuthPAMExpiredRedirect
is specified with a URL, redirect is made to that location. For
FreeIPA server, the setting would be

    AuthPAMExpiredRedirect https://<IPA-server>/ipa/ui/reset_password.html

It is also possible to use placeholders in the URL that will be replaced
with current location (for backreference) and username (to prefill)
on the target page:

	%s	URL of the current page.
	%u	The username that was used for the PAM authentication.
	%%	The character % itself.

For example for FreeIPA 4.1+, the value can actually be

    https://<IPA-server>/ipa/ui/reset_password.html?url=%s

SELinux:

On SELinux enabled systems, boolean allow_httpd_mod_auth_pam needs to
be enabled:

    setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_pam 1

Building from sources
---------------------

When building from sources, command

    apxs -i -a -c mod_authnz_pam.c -lpam -Wall -pedantic

should build and install the module.
